      <p>My 2025 artweek exhibition differs from those of previous years because it is a retrospective – a pre-retirement sale of works from various stages of my 22-year career as a jeweller.</p>
      <p>I am fascinated by process and my work changed over the years as I discovered new materials and ways of working. In the beginning, I worked a lot with semi-precious stones; for several years I used the Japanese technique of <em>keum boo</em>, contrasting black, oxidised silver with 24ct gold. Latterly, I explored vibrant colour through the medium of vitreous enamel.</p>
      <p>Prices are modest by today’s standards, reflecting the fact that,&nbsp;in the past, precious metals and semi-precious stones cost a lot less than they do now. </p>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Price guide</h4>
      <p>Silver items £50 to £150<br />Silver and gold £75-£200<br />Jewellery items £90 to £500<br /></p>
