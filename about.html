      <p>My aim is to make fine, contemporary jewellery for everyday wear.</p>
      <p>I work with gold and silver, often using the two together. When the silver is oxidised the result is a distinctive contrast of black and gold. These techniques are also used in combination with semi-precious stones.</p>
      <p>This year I have been developing a range of &lsquo;bee&rsquo; jewellery &ndash; inspired by the bees I keep on an allotment in North Oxford.</p>
      <p>I have also been working on a range of contemporary earrings for non-pierced ears which are beautiful, lightweight and comfortable.</p>
      <p>My work is quite delicate and often features assymetrical designs. Most of my pieces are &lsquo;one-off&rsquo;; some are produced in a limited range; all are made with meticulous care and attention to detail.</p>
      <h3>Purchasing work</h3>
